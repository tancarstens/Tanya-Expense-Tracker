🚀 Tanya's Financial Tracker
Welcome to your personal financial dashboard! This tool is designed to help you take control of your money by tracking your budget and expenses in real-time.

🛠 How to Use Your Tracker
1. Set Your Budget
When you first open the app, your budget will be R 0.00.

Scroll to the Budget Settings section.

Enter the total amount of money you have for the month.

Click Update Total Budget. Your "Balance" will automatically update!

2. Add an Expense
Whenever you spend money, log it immediately:

Description: What did you buy? (e.g., "Movie Ticket").

Amount: How much did it cost?

Date: When did you buy it?

Category: Is it Food, Entertainment, or Transport?

Click Add Expense to see your balance drop and your "Total Spent" rise.

3. Save Your Data
Automatic Saving: The app remembers your data on this specific browser.

Download to Excel: Use the green button to download a backup of your expenses. This is great for looking back at your spending at the end of the year!

💡 Pro Tips
The "Clear All" Button: Use this only when you want to reset everything for a brand-new month.

Mobile Access: Bookmark this link on your phone’s home screen so you can log expenses the moment you tap your card!

🔒 Privacy Note
Your data is stored locally on your device. This means no one else can see what you spend unless they are using your physical phone or laptop.
